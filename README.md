DevOps Against Humanity (an expansion for [Cards Against Humanity](http://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com))

Because people on twitter are hilarious.

### Card lists

The google doc is here:

[Shared Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OKgmjNz8l7skYfrbrOtYT6QmSf_y-BzZOWJWZC3tbUQ/edit#gid=0)

Add your awesome ideas to the shared doc. Then copy it, edit it to your liking, sorting and removing anything you don't like. I ended up going with a standard of five underscores for each blank, since otherwise they can take up too much room on the cards.

I wouldn't be sad if someone wanted to merge in my cleanup/adds/changes to the shared doc, although I don't have time right now. This is the actual doc I used for generating the PDFs in this repo:

[Doc used for first printing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LEf6qE3FMKRvSWRrKb3m5gcVHmw7aQctbegrWbxEsfA/edit?usp=sharing)

I've added CSVs to this repo preserving the state of the doc used for first printing and an export of the current state of the shared doc (which will be updated intermittently). I've no desire to approve all additions to the shared doc.

### Generating the PDFs

I googled around and found a number of generators, but most made smaller cards than I wanted. Then I found [this thread on boardgamegeek](http://rpggeek.com/thread/1160850/bigger-blacker-cards-another-custom-cah-card-pdf-g)

Either install https://github.com/bbcards/bbcards somewhere yourself, or run it on this site: http://biggerblackercards.com

Because I wanted to use a different custom logo on white cards vs black, I made two PDFs. That turned out to be good since I needed to print the black cards in color for them to look good, while the white ones were fine in black & white. When I wanted only one, I just made sure the other side (black or white) was blank.

I went with the rectangular 2.5"x3.5" poker size cards because I want to be able to mix them in with the official cards.

### Chromecast
These cards, as of 2014-09-01 have been [imported into Cardcast](http://www.cardcastgame.com/browse/deck/HFU3S) for play with a Chromecast. The deck code is `HFU3S`.

### Printing

I put the PDFs on a USB stick and had them printed on 110lb cardstock at Kinko's. Any print shop should be able to do this. Cards Against Humanity ([in their official printing directions](http://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com/pdf/CAH_MainGame.pdf)) suggests going with at least 80lb cardstock. Cutting ~300 cards on the slicing machine took about 45min because I wanted them to look fairly consistent. I could only stack 4 sheets at a time; at 5, the cuts were no longer clean.

Cards Against Humanity also suggests printing plain black on the back of the black cards. I made an all-black page in OpenOffice and exported it to PDF. 

### Pull requests accepted!

It would be cool if someone designed awesome card backs for black and white DAH cards. Obviously many more awesome cards could be created. Print all you want, because I am done operating that slicing machine at this point. :)
